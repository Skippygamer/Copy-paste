# Clipboard Typing Script

This Python script allows you to type the content of your clipboard instantly by pressing 'CTRL + B'. It uses the `pyperclip` and `keyboard` libraries.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pyperclip keyboard
```

# Run the Script
```bash
python index.py
```


 Press 'CTRL + B' to instantly type the content of your clipboard.
 The script continuously checks for changes in the clipboard. 
 If 'CTRL + B' is pressed, it types the current clipboard content.

 You can adjust the delay in the script if needed.

Uncomment the line `# pyperclip.copy('')` if you want to clear the clipboard after typing.
